## Front-end

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Back-end

### Running back-end service

Run `npm run dev` to start the node server. The server will connect automatically to mongodb and will log `connected to db` once it is connected.

## Feedback incorporated

### How does this application support other food cultures?

Answer: Added various religiously affiliated diets to the list of dietary restrictions such as "Kosher" and "Halal"

### It would be nice if the guests did not have to RSVP, the host could just add people to a group to see what allergies they should be aware of

Answer: Simplifed event creation. Just add friends and see the combined list of allergies and dietary restrictions. No need for them to RSVP.

### Page forms (e.g. Events form) and content looks a little cluttered

Answer: Simplified the look and feel of Events creation. Adopted a pre-made bootstrap UI for better looks instead of building from scratch.
